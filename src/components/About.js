      <p> 
        Hello, my name is Brian Morse. I was an Arabic Cryptologic Linguist in the Marine Corps, a child abuse investigator in California and Oregon, and an Army Reserves Mortuary Affairs Specialist. I have a degree in Psychology and am currently attending the University of Oregon coding bootcamp, with a graduation date of July 17, 2023.<br/><br/>

        Over the years, I have gained valuable experience in different fields, from the military to social work. I have developed a strong sense of adaptability, a sharp eye for detail, and a unique problem-solving skillset. As a child abuse investigator and foster resource home certifier, I honed my communication, interpersonal, and organizational skills, as well as my ability to work under pressure and in sensitive situations. <br/><br/>
            
        Now, I am excited to pursue a career in web development as a full stack web developer. I am eager to use my skills and experience to develop innovative solutions and put my shoulder to the wheel to achieve group goals. I am a quick learner, a team player, and a hard worker. I am committed to continuously improving my skills and knowledge in this dynamic and ever-changing field.<br/><br/>
            
        Please enjoy yourself while looking around my portfolio site. I'm always looking to improve my skills and am open to any and all suggestions. If you have feedback, encouragement, advice, or criticism, please provide it to me by using the contact link or my contact information below. Thank you for coming by, and have an excellent day.
